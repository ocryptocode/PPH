Project Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the key components and steps involved in the project.

1. Application Setup

A Flask web application is created to serve as the project's foundation.
Two routes are defined: /hello for a simple response and / for rendering an HTML template.
2. Database Handling

Data is read from an Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame.
New rows are added to the DataFrame, and a function is applied to check payment validation.
Payments data is identified, merged, and utilized to create payment statements using Microsoft Word.
3. Text Classification Model

A text classification pipeline is implemented using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.
The model is trained and evaluated for accuracy on the dataset.
4. Custom Transformer and Seq2Seq Model

A custom transformer and a Seq2Seq model with a transformer encoder are implemented using PyTorch.
5. BERT for Sequence Classification

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is employed for sequence classification tasks.
6. GPT-2 for Text Generation

GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) is utilized for text generation.
7. Custom Class and Pipeline

A custom class and pipeline are defined for data transformation and processing.
8. PyTorch Model Training

A simple neural network is trained using PyTorch, including the definition of the model, loss function, and optimizer.
9. DataLoader for Efficient Data Loading

The DataLoader is introduced for efficient loading of data in batches.
10. Fine-tuning BERT Model

BERT is fine-tuned on a specific task using a training loop.
11. Learning Rate Scheduling

Learning rate scheduling is implemented for adaptive optimization during training.
12. Running the Application

The Flask application is run with debug mode enabled.
